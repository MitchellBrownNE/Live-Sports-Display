            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a team of six students leveraging the scrum methodology to bring a unique project to lifeâ€”Motion Matrix Media. Our platform bridges the gap between fantasy basketball and real-time sports analytics. By using OCR technology, we've developed a system where users can upload screenshots of their fantasy basketball rosters. Our website processes these images to identify player names and uses Raspberry Pi devices to gather live player statistics from Sportradar's API. The live stats are then displayed on LED boards, creating an interactive and immersive experience for fantasy basketball enthusiasts. This project is not just a testament to our passion for sports and technology but also an ongoing learning journey in software development and teamwork.</p>

        <div id="How-To" class="section">
            <h2>How To</h2>
            <p>1. Navigate to the 'Upload Roster' page to submit your fantasy basketball team screenshot.</p>
            <p>2. Upload your screenshot. Our OCR technology processes the image to extract player names.</p>
            <p>3. Review that the names are correct and select the ones you want sent to your display </p>
            <p>4. Player stats are retrieved in real-time from Sportradar's API and displayed on our LED displays.</p>
